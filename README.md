# Simple Calculator Using HTML, CSS and Javascript
This calculator was made for [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s foundation course's final project. It is a simple calculator made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The placing of elements was done using flexbox.

Some features I am planning to add later (when I have time) are:
- keyboard support
- view operation history

Site is now currently viewable [here](https://oukoutdam.github.io/OdinProject-Calculator/).
